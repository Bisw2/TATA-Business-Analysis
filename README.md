# TATA-Business-Analysis
In this Project i learn that what  the Chief executives want from a data analyst and presentation skill.
After scrubing the negative value from the different column i hope into the visualisation part. As the per the CEO,CMo 
reequirement the visulisations created.

1- Year& month wise sales to Forcast the future sales
2- top coutries and their sales with profit
3-top customers and their contribution 
4- top products 


From anlysis i found that their is a sesssional hike in their sales and their sales depend on mostly top 2-3 customers , their sales is not diversified , and their one product is highly demande . Now most imp. qs they want to expand their business , they asked my opinion on that , So i suggest them acc to my knowledge amd based on error free , on point analysis .



Thank you
